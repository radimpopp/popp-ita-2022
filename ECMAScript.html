          When JavaScript was first introduced by Netscape, there was a war
          going on between all the browser vendors on the market at the time.
          Microsoft and several other browser vendors implemented their own
          versions of JavaScript (with different names and syntax) in their
          respective browsers. This created a huge headache for developers, as
          code that worked fine on one browser was a total waste on another.
          This went on for a while till they all agreed to use the same language
          (JavaScript) in their browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, Netscape submitted JavaScript to the European Computer
          Manufacturers Association (ECMA) for standardization in order to
          ensure proper maintenance and support of the language. Since
          JavaScript was standardized by ECMA, it was officially named
          ECMAScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, the name ECMAScript was just the formalization of
          JavaScript, but now languages like JScript and ActionScript are also
          based on the ECMAScript standard. They can be thought of like 3
          different cars using the same engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript has two major host environments: browsers and Node.js.
          These environments add some APIs to the language. If you strip all the
          external APIs from these environments, you get ECMAScript. In simple
          words, you can think of ECMAScript as JavaScript without a host
          environment.
