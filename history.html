          <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a programming language that represents
          one of the three core languages used to develop websites, alongside
          <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>. Whereas <em>HTML</em> and
          <em>CSS</em> give a website structure and style,
          <strong>JavaScript</strong> lets you add functionality and behaviors
          to your website. This allows visitors to interact with your website in
          various creative ways.

          Mosaic was the first web browser with a graphical user interface. It
          was first released in 1993 and played a key role in the rapid
          development of the web as we know it today. The lead developers of
          Mosaic founded Netscape (now Mozilla) and released a more elegant
          browser called Netscape Navigator in 1994.

          During the early years of the web, web pages were only static, with no
          capability for dynamic behavior and interactivity. As a result, there
          was an urge in the web development community at the time to eliminate
          this limitation. This led Netscape to the decision to add a scripting
          language to the Navigator browser.

          In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brendan Eich developed
          a new scripting language in just 10 days. It was originally called
          <strong>Mocha</strong>, but quickly became known as
          <strong>LiveScript</strong> and, later, <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The language derived its syntax from <em>Java</em>, its first-class
          functions from Scheme, and its prototype-based inheritance from Self.
          Since then, <strong>JavaScript</strong> has been adopted by all major
          graphical web browsers.
