# History of JavaScript

## Description of the Website

The website is devised as a brief reminder of **JavaScript history**. The site consists of 5 webpages:

1. Home Page
2. History
3. JavaScript x Java
4. ECMAScript
5. JavaScript Today

The whole site is responsive and made with _HTML_ and _CSS_ along with a touch of **JavaScript** to let you know about the current navbar section. Even though I mastered Grid Garden along with Flexbox Froggy, I resorted to the skills acquired from the latter in the project.

> Flexbox Froggy picture to let you know that I am familiar with implementation of images with link into markdown file along with a blockquote.

The main features are:

- navbar
  - logo that takes you to the home page
  - other list item elements that redirects you to the corresponding webpage
- stolen text content and images
- footer
  - with a disclaimer
  - link to the source webpage

## Author

The author of this project is Radim Popp. Disclaimer: it is not Poop. radimpopp@gmail.com is not a prank email address as well as many tend to think. Popp is my real last name. I did not choose it. If I could decide what my last name would be, I would have settle on something more sophisticated like Piss. That would be golden. Literally.
