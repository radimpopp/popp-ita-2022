        <p>
          According to GitHub’s 2021 Octoverse report, there are more JavaScript
          code repositories than any other language, and that number is steadily
          on the rise.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript can be found virtually everywhere on the Internet. It has
          been named the most widely used programming language several times
          with over 64.9 percent of developers using it in 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          A series of JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as Ember,
          Angular, React, and Vue have also been created to develop powerful and
          complicated web applications. Also, alongside client and server
          software, it is now even possible to write native mobile apps using
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          From its rocky start, JavaScript is now used to build more than 90% of
          websites on the web, including some of the world’s largest web
          applications like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has now outgrown its scripting-language roots to become a robust
          and efficient general-purpose language. This makes it clear that
          JavaScript is going to be with us for many years to come.
